            <b style="color:darkblue;">What Is Decreasing Term Life Insurance?</b><br>
            <p>Term Life Insurance plans keep you covered financially for a set period of time. With a decreasing term life insurance policy, the death benefit for the plan decreases over time. These plans are generally more affordable than other types of term life insurance, making them a smart choice if you just need insurance to cover a temporary need or plan to leave little to no debt for your family to pay off.</p><br>
            <b style="color:darkblue;">How does Decreasing Term Life Insurance Work?<br></b>
            <p>Decreasing term insurance, also known as DTA insurance, is different from a standard term policy, or level term life insurance, in the payout structure. While a level term life insurance policy has a face value that remains constant over the life of the policy, the death benefit decreases either monthly or annually for decreasing term insurance. However, the two policies are similar in that they both have constant premiums and term lengths that typically span five to 30 years.</p>

            <p>
                <ul style="color: rgb(35, 3, 151);">
                    <li>In the case of small businesses, if one partner dies, the death benefit proceeds from the decreasing term policy can help to fund continuing operations or retire the percentage of the remaining debt for which the deceased partner is responsible. The security allows the business to guarantee commercial loan amounts affordably.</li><br>
                    <li>Decreasing term insurance is a more affordable option than whole life or universal life insurance. The death benefit is designed to mirror the amortization schedule of a mortgage or other personal debt not easily covered by personal assets or income, like personal loans or business loans</li><br>
                    <li>Decreasing term insurance allows a pure death benefit with no cash accumulation, unlike, for example, a whole life insurance policy. As such, this insurance option has modest premiums for comparable benefit amounts to either a permanent or temporary life insurance.</li>

        <h3>Convertible Term Life Insurance</h3>

            <b style="color:darkblue;">What Is Convertible Term Life Insurance?</b><br>
            <p>A convertible insurance policy is a term related to life insurance. Term life insurance is a policy that provides the insured person coverage for a certain period of time. On the other hand, a "whole" or "universal" policy is considered permanent, providing coverage for the entire life of the insured. Now, a convertible term policy allows the insured to convert a term policy to a permanent policy at a later date.</p>
            <b style="color:darkblue;">How does Convertible Term Life Insurance Work?</b><br>
            <p>As long as the conditions of the policy have been maintained and payments made on time, the insured person is not required to undergo any new or additional screening at the time the policy is converted, regardless of his/her medical condition.</p>
            <b style="color:darkblue;">Benifits of Convertible Term Life Insurance</b><br>
            <p>
                <ul style="color: rgb(35, 3, 151);">
                    <li>A term policy can last for decades, and many health changes can happen in that time. For example, after a routine health exam, you could be diagnosed with a chronic condition such as diabetes. Even if well managed, it could significantly raise the cost of a new policy later on. Worse yet, your health could take a severe turn for the worse; in that case, conversion could be the only viable way to stay insured and provide the protection you want for your loved ones.</li><br>
                    <li>One of the first decisions you have to make when buying a term life policy is how long you want your term to last. Many people want life insurance to protect their family while the children are still growing up, so they buy a policy that lasts until the youngest child reaches adulthood or finishes college. That's a good plan, but things could change. For example, you could have another child or have other family dependents to support. A convertible policy can give you the flexibility you need to adapt to changing situations.</li><br>
                    <li>As you get older, life insurance becomes more expensive. Suppose you're just looking to get a 10-year term policy now but concerned about the higher cost to renew coverage when you're ten years older. In that case, convertibility gives you an added extension option if you need it later on. </li><br>
                    <li>The truth is, most term insurance policies expire without paying a death benefit, because most people outlive the length of their policy.  That’s a good thing!  But it also means you may not see a return on your premiums paid. After a few years of making regular premium payments, you may decide you'd rather build value with a permanent life insurance policy. Conversion may be the easiest and most affordable way to make that happen.</li>

            <b style="color:darkblue;">What Is Renewable Term Life Insurance?</b><br>
            <p>Renewable Term plans A convertible insurance policy is a term related to life insurance. Term life insurance is a policy that provides the insured person coverage for a certain period of time. On the other hand, a "whole" or "universal" policy is considered permanent, providing coverage for the entire life of the insured. Now, a convertible term policy allows the insured to convert a term policy to a permanent policy at a later date.</p>
            <b style="color:darkblue;">How does Renewable Term Life Insurance Work?</b><br>
            <p>We can see how a renewable policy works with an example. Assume Mr Kumar purchases a 30-year term insurance policy when he’s 25 with an annual renewable option. He pays annual premiums to renew the coverage each year. As long as he pays the premiums on time, he will continue to enjoy the promised coverage for the next 30 years.</p>

                <ul style="color: rgb(35, 3, 151);">
                    <li>Easy Renewals<br>
                        As the name suggests, renewable plans facilitate quick and easy life cover renewals. You do not have to undergo periodic medical tests or requalify for your life coverage. Instead, you simply need to pay your premiums on time to continue to enjoy the life coverage you selected when you purchased the plan.</li>
                    <li>Guaranteed Life Cover<br>
                        Renewal term policies do not require you to requalify for insurance, effectively guaranteeing your life cover for the selected period. The only condition for the cover remains premium payment. If you fail to make your payment on time and the policy lapses, all the benefits end, including renewability and life coverage.</li>
                    <li>Financial Stability for Your Family<br>
                        Crucially, renewable term plans provide your family with the sum assured payout in case something happens to you. The financial benefit they receive from a term policy enables them to repay any pending debts and keep their finances secure even after a tragedy.</li>
