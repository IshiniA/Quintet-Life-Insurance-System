            <b style="color:darkblue;">What Is Whole Life Insurance?</b><br>
            <p>Whole life insurance is one of two main types of life insurance (the other being term life). The idea behind whole life is to insure you for the entirety of your life. Typically, a whole life policy will be in force until the insured's 100th or 120th birthday. Because such longevity is a rare occurrence, the policy tends to live up to its name.<br> 
                The level premiums for whole life tend to be significantly higher than a comparable amount of term life coverage. Whole life insurance also includes a cash element From which you can borrow or use to pay the policy's premiums<br>
                Whole life insurance has several sub-categories, including universal life, variable universal life, and flexible or adjustable premium life.
            </p>
            
            <b style="color:darkblue;">How does Whole Life Insurance Work?</b><br>
            <p>Whole life insurance works as a permanent policy that builds cash value over time. As long as the premiums are current, the policy remains active for the entire life of the policyholder, and beneficiaries will receive a set death benefit upon the insured's death.<br>
                The insured pays fixed level premiums, which are allotted between several portions: <br>
                <ul style="color: rgb(35, 3, 151);">
                    <li>Partial funding for the policy’s face value (the death benefit)</li>
                    <li>The insurer’s operating costs, cost of insuring you, and profits</li>
                    <li>Contributions to the cash value account</li>
                </ul><br>
            </p>

            <b style="color:darkblue;">Benifits of Whole Life Insurance</b><br>
            <p>Whole life insurance works for people that want long-term protection and can afford the high premium rates: <br>
                <ul style="color: rgb(35, 3, 151);">
                    <li>Parents -  To ensure your children's financial well-being (fund education, build a trust for children with special needs, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Couples -  To cover daily and future living expenses, such as mortgage payments, for a spouse or partner</li>
                    <li>Older adults - To cover financial obligations, funeral costs, final expenses, and supplement Social Security Income</li>
                    <li>Business owners  - To ensure the operation of a business after the owner’s death or to cover debt related to operations, especially if it’s backed by assets (like a family home) or the family needs to buy out a partner</li>
                    <li>People who need estate planning - To help your loved ones cover estate taxes, asset management and other death-related expenses in case of the policy owner’s unexpected or accidental death.</li>
                    <li>Businesses that need to insure a “key employee”  - To buffer any financial setbacks after the loss of an essential employee</li>
                </ul>

            <b style="color:darkblue;">What Is Indexed Universal Life Insurance?</b><br>
            <p>Indexed universal life (IUL) insurance is a type of permanent life insurance, meaning it has a cash value component along with a death benefit. The money in a policyholder's cash value account can earn interest by tracking a stock market index selected by the insurer, such as the Nasdaq-100 or the Standard & Poor's 500.1 You may also have a fixed-rate account and can choose how much you want to go into each account.
                Although the interest rate derived from the equity index account can fluctuate, the policy does offer an interest rate guarantee, which limits your losses.2 It also may cap your gains. These policies are more volatile than fixed universal life policies, but less risky than variable UL insurance policies because no investment is made in equity positions.   
            </p>
            
            <b style="color:darkblue;">How does Indexed Universal Life Insurance Work?</b><br>
            <p>As with universal life insurance, IUL policies have adjustable premiums. You can underpay or skip premiums, and you may be able to adjust your death benefit as well. What makes IUL different is the way the cash value is invested.
                When you take out an indexed universal life insurance policy, the insurance company will help you select the index to use for all or part of the cash value account segment of your policy and your death benefit. When a premium is paid on the account, a portion pays the cost of insurance based on the insured's life. Any fees are paid, and the rest is added to the cash value.

                    <li>Contributions to the cash value account</li>
                    <li>Death benefit: This benefit is permanent, not subject to income or death taxes, and not required to go through probate</li>
                    <li>Less risk: The policy is not directly invested in the stock market, thus reducing risk.</li>
                    <li>Easier distribution: The cash value in IUL insurance policies can be accessed at any time without penalty, regardless of a person’s age</li>
                    <li>Unlimited contribution: IUL insurance policies have no limitations on annual contributions</li>
                </ul><br>

                    <li>Flexible premiums: As with standard universal life insurance, the policyholder can increase their premiums or lower them in times of hardship</li>
                    <li>Cash value accumulation: Amounts credited to the cash value grow tax-deferred. The cash value can pay the insurance premiums, allowing the policyholder to reduce or stop making out-of-pocket premium payments</li>
                    <li>Investment flexibility: The policyholder controls the amount risked in equity-indexed accounts, and the death benefit amounts can be adjusted as needed. Most IUL insurance policies offer a host of optional riders, from death benefit guarantees to no-lapse guarantees.</li>

        <b style="color:darkblue;">What Is Variable Universal Life Insurance?</b><br>
        <p>Variable universal life (VUL) is a type of permanent life insurance policy with a built-in savings component that allows for the investment of the cash value. Like standard universal life insurance, the premium is flexible.
            VUL insurance has investment subaccounts that allow for the investment of the cash value. The function of the subaccounts is similar to a mutual fund. Exposure to market fluctuations can generate significant returns, but may also result in substantial losses. This insurance gets its name from the varying results of investment in the ever-fluctuating market. While VUL insurance offers increased flexibility and growth potential over a traditional cash value or a whole life insurance policy, policyholders should carefully assess the risks before purchasing it.        
        </p>
        
        <b style="color:darkblue;">How does Variable Universal Life Insurance Work?</b><br>
        <p>Like universal life insurance, VUL insurance combines a savings component with a separate death benefit, allowing for greater flexibility in managing the policy. Premiums are paid into the savings component.
            For a VUL insurance policy, the savings element consists of separately managed accounts, referred to as “subaccounts.” Each year the life insurer deducts what it needs to cover mortality and administrative costs. The rest remains in the separate accounts to earn further interest.
            Variable universal life insurance is a type of universal life insurance — which gives you flexibility when it comes to how much you pay in premiums and the amount of your death benefit over time. What makes a variable universal life insurance policy different from a traditional universal life contract is that you have more control in determining how your cash value is invested. This allows you to take a more active role in your life insurance policy. Here’s how variable universal life insurance works.
