                    <b style="color:darkblue;">Insured</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the individual who is covered by the policy and whose life is protected. When this person dies, payment will be made to the beneficiary</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b style="color:darkblue;">PolicyHolder</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the person who bought the policy. It is usually the insured. For example, if I purchase $30,000 insurance on myself and name my children as beneficiaries, I am both a policyholder and insured.

                            If I obtain a $20,000 policy on my spouse, I become the policyholder while she becomes the insured.
                            
                            The policyholder has the option to cancel and change the beneficiaries on the insurance. The insured does not have this legal right unless they are the policyholder. This is crucial information.
                            
                            “So, can someone buy a life insurance policy on you, and you have no legal authority to change it?” Yes.
                            
                            When someone purchases a life insurance policy on you in New York, they must usually have your consent by signing a form. Exceptions to this rule are small policies taken out on spouses--usually $15,000 or less--and children under the age of 15.
                            
                            If you did not give your consent and found out about the policy after it was purchased, you would then need to take extra-legal measures.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <b style="color:darkblue;">Cash Value</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cash value of a whole life insurance policy is the money you have available to loan out. You can spend this cash value from your already paid premium. However, taking out this money is not advisable unless it is an extreme financial emergency</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b style="color:darkblue;">Face Value</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The agent's initial, non-negotiable sales pitch. This is the amount the policy will pay out if no debts or penalties are associated</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This insurance is guaranteed for the rest of your life. It is never terminated.
                    The policy price does not change, so it will not rise as you age. The Face Value of the policy will not alter. It also accrues value in the form of cash.
                    As a result, part of your premium payments goes toward a savings account for you to use when you want it. Also, whenever you need money, you may borrow it from yourself. More on this later. So why would anybody choose term over the whole?”
                    Many people choose term insurance over whole life insurance because it is cheaper; a $250,000 policy costs only $25 per month, while the entire life would be $25 per week.
                    Both whole life insurance and term insurance have their advantages, which make them more useful in different ways.
                    For example, if you have a $300,000 mortgage that will last for 30 years, you could get a $300,000 term policy covering you for those same 30 years.
                    That way, if something happens to you during that period, your family can use the money from the policy to pay off the mortgage and keep the house.
                    Term Insurance is suitable for covering specific periods in your life when there is a greater financial risk.
                    What I find wrong and misleading is when financial "experts" act as if whole life policies are useless. If you take the time to think about this is an ignorant perspective. They continually advocate for term life insurance as being cheaper and better.
                    They say you can get more coverage with a term policy, but what happens when you live past the age limit? They never answer that question. For example, in New York State, insurers will not cover anyone over 80 years old for term life insurance.
                    After 80, your policy expires, and there is no renewing it--you are out of luck.
                    Have you ever thought about how much your life insurance policy might cost if you live to be older than 80 years old?
                    A whole life policy could cost as much as $40/month for only $6,000 if you can find someone to insure you. So, why would you not get a much more cost-effective whole-life policy when you are younger and will most likely need it for a more extended period?
                    Let us assume you are 20 years old and $100,000 in whole-life costs $40 a month, for example, and that you continue to pay the same premium (monthly payment) until you reach 80 years old (never having to re-qualify), after which your beneficiary gets paid.
                    Does not this make more sense?
                    The fact is that most term policies expire without having been paid out because the insured survives beyond the term. According to some reports, as little as 1% of term policies pay a death benefit.
                    That means insurance companies keep 99 percent of premiums but pay nothing.
                            •	Only 25% of term insurance policies are in force after ten years. - (LIMRA, Life Insurance Marketing, and Research Association)
                            •	Only one percent of term policies provide a death benefit. - (New York Life Study, a renowned insurance provider.)
                    If you die during a specific period, term life insurance is the option.
                    Whole life insurance is designed to cover you when you pass away. It is disgusting that these business authorities mislead people into buying products for the wrong reasons.
